Hello, everyone!

On behalf of the OpenDAL community, I'm pleased to announce that the first Apache OpenDAL™ Beijing Meetup will be held on September 14th.

## Talks

Five 10-15 minute talks about opendal.

- [@tisonkun](https://github.com/tisonkun/) about OpenDAL Community Growth
- [@WenyXu](https://github.com/WenyXu/) for using OpenDAL in [GreptimeDB](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb)
- [@wcy-fdu](https://github.com/wcy-fdu/) for using OpenDAL in [RisingWave](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave)
- [@drmingdrmer](https://github.com/wcy-fdu/) for using OpenDAL in [OpenRaft](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft)
- [@Xuanwo](https://github.com/Xuanwo/) about OpenDAL Core 1.0

## Breakouts / Discussions

The idea is that we will break into small groups for 3 x 20 minute sessions. I will ring a gong or something similar every 20 minutes and you should find a new group to discuss.

Potential seed topics (but obviously feel free to discuss anything):

- How do we make it easier for people to build systems on OpenDAL? What are the current barriers to community growth as you see them?
- How do we make it easier for people to contribute back to OpenDAL? What are the current barriers to contribution
- What features would you like to see / not see

Ideally, in each session, one or more people would volunteer to write up any insights they got from the discussions, and post them to the overall ticket.

Looking forward to meet you in this meetup!
