Apache OpenDAL offers native layer support, enabling users to implement middleware or intercept for all operations.

By using layers, we can:

- `RetryLayer`: Automatically retry failed requests and resume from the point of failure.
- `ChaosLayer`: Generate simulated chaos for storage services.
- `ConcurrentLimitLayer`: Set concurrent limit while accessing storage services.
- `{Logging|Metrics|Tracing}Layer`: Provide native observability for storage services.
