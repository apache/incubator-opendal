  <property>
    <name>hadoop.security.credential.provider.path</name>
    <value>localjceks://file/tmp/hdfs/s3.jceks</value>
    <description>Path to interrogate for protected aws s3 storage credentials.</description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>fs.s3a.endpoint</name>
    <value>http://127.0.0.1:9000</value>
    <description>AWS S3 endpoint to connect to. An up-to-date list is
      provided in the AWS Documentation: regions and endpoints. Without this
      property, the standard region (s3.amazonaws.com) is assumed.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>fs.s3a.endpoint.region</name>
    <value>us-east-1</value>
    <description>AWS S3 region for a bucket, which bypasses the parsing of
      fs.s3a.endpoint to know the region. Would be helpful in avoiding errors
      while using privateLink URL and explicitly set the bucket region.
      If set to a blank string (or 1+ space), falls back to the
      (potentially brittle) SDK region resolution process.
