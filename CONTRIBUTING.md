# Contributing

Hello, welcome to the OpenDAL Community! Thanks for your interest in the Apache OpenDAL project! This document will guide you on how to participate in our community and enjoy your time here. 

## Code of Conduct

We expect all community members to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html).

## Communication

We use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/apache/incubator-opendal/discussions) for general discussions and questions. Please use the `Q&A` category for questions and the `General` category for general discussions.

We also use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/apache/incubator-opendal/issues) for bug reports and feature requests.

Otherwise, you can join our [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/XQy8yGR2dg) for real-time discussions.

## Taking Issues

It is highly recommended to request an assignment before beginning work on any issues to avoid conflicts with other community members.

It is encouraged to post your work progress in the issues comment so that the community can stay informed about ongoing developments and offer any necessary assistance.

It is possible that your assignment has been removed after 14 days of no updates. Please note that this is not a punishment or dissatisfaction from the community. We understand that life can be challenging, and things may not always go as planned.

By removing the assignment, we create space for other community members to take over. Additionally, we do not frequently check the assignment due date, so please communicate any stale issues through the issue tracker.

## Sending PRs

If you find an issue you would like to fix, open a pull request. For code changes, please refer to the particular component's development guide.

We will try our best to review your PRs within 24 hours, and often within 8 hours.

If a PR does not receive a response within 24 hours, it will be converted to draft status. To indicate that you are ready for review, please mark the PR as `ready for review`.
