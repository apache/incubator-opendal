# OpenDAL Rust Examples

Thank you for using OpenDAL Rust Core!

The goal of these documents is to give you everything you need to start using OpenDAL Rust Core. We will start with the Rust basics and move on to more OpenDAL features. After reading and using all these examples, we hope you will become a master of OpenDAL and be empowered to build your bravo applications!

## Layout

Our examples are organised like a book with different chapters.

It's a good idea to start reading from the first chapter. It's also ok to pick the topics that interest you the most. Each chapter will be a separate project that can be run and referenced.
