The official Apache OpenDAL (incubating) releases are as source artifacts.

## Releases

The latest source release is [0.44.1](
https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/incubator/opendal/0.44.1/apache-opendal-incubating-0.44.1-src.tar.gz?action=download) ([asc](https://downloads.apache.org/incubator/opendal/0.44.1/apache-opendal-incubating-0.44.1-src.tar.gz.asc),

For older releases, please check the [archive](https://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/opendal/).

## Verifying Hashes and Signatures

Along with our releases, we also provide sha512 hashes in `*.sha512` files and cryptographic signatures in `*.asc` files. The Apache Software Foundation has an extensive tutorial to [verify hashes and signatures](http://www.apache.org/info/verification.html) which you can follow by using any of these release-signing [KEYS](https://downloads.apache.org/incubator/opendal/KEYS).
