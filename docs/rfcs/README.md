- Submit PR and assign the RFC number with the PR number.
- Adding into [index of rfcs](../SUMMARY.md) for better rendered.

Some useful tips:

- Start a pre-propose in [discussion](https://github.com/datafuselabs/opendal/discussions/categories/ideas) to communicate quickly.
- The proposer of RFC may not be the same person as the implementor. Try to include enough information in RFC itself.
