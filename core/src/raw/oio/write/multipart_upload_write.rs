/// The architecture after adopting [`MultipartUploadWrite`]:

/// - Services impl `MultipartUploadWrite`
/// - `MultipartUploadWriter` impl `Write`

///
/// `MultipartUploadWrite` has an oneshot optimization when `write` has been called only once:
///
/// ```no_build
/// w.write(bs).await?;
/// w.close().await?;
/// ```
///
/// We will use `write_once` instead of starting a new multipart upload.
