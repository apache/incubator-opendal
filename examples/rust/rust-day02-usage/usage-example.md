# Basic Usage

In this section, we chose `Fs` service as example bacause it is simple and don't need extra work to set up, all service available can be found [here](https://docs.rs/opendal/latest/opendal/services/index.html).

There is a independent project name `project-day02`, the `src/main.rs` provide a example usage about `Fs`. It `read` a file and print its conten to console, overwrite some new content to it and read & print content again to verify the `write` operator has been taken effect, copy a new file and then delete the old one.

Just take a try.
