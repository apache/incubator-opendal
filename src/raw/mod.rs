//! Raw modules provide raw APIs that used by underlying services
//!
//! ## Notes
//!
//! - Only developers who want to develop new services or layers need to
//!   access raw APIs.
//! - Raw APIs should only be accessed via `opendal::raw::Xxxx`, any public
//!   API should never expose raw API directly.
//! - Raw APIs are far more less stable than public API, please don't rely on
//!   them whenever possible.
