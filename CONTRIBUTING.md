# Contributing

Hello, welcome to the OpenDAL Community! This document will guide you on how to participate in our community and enjoy your time here.

## Taking Issues

It is highly recommended to request an assignment before beginning work on any issues to avoid conflicts with other community members.

It is encouraged to post your work progress in the issues comment so that the community can stay informed about ongoing developments and offer any necessary assistance.

It is possible that your assignment has been removed after 14 days of no updates. Please note that this is not a punishment or dissatisfaction from the community. We understand that life can be challenging, and things may not always go as planned.

By removing the assignment, we create space for other community members to take over. Additionally, we do not frequently check the assignment due date, so please communicate any stale issues through the issue tracker.

## Sending PRs

We will try our best to review your PRs within 24 hours, and often within 8 hours.

If a PR does not receive a response within 24 hours, it will be converted to draft status. To indicate that you are ready for review, please mark the PR as `ready for review`.
